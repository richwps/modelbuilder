            <p>Interface to bordering RichWPS servers.</p>
            <p>
                Used to wps-/wpst-Requestss against a given RichWPS server.
                Therefore it makes use of <b>ExecuteRequestDTO</b>
                and <b>DeployRequestDTO</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the connect-Methods imply, a RichWPS server is <b>uniquely</b> 
                identified by a wps-endpoint. A RichWPS server wit transactional
                capabilities is instantiated with both, the wps- and
                wpst-endpoint.
            </p>

            <p><b>ExecuteRequestDTO</b>
                Object that can be used to perfom an
                wps:describeProcess()- and wps:execute()-Request.
                Object that starts out with an endpoint and a processidentifier.
                The RichWPSProvider can then be used to describe the remote process
                by retreiving according IInputSpecifiers and IOutputSpecifiers.
                Based on those descriptions IInputArguments and IOutputArguments 
                can be set. Once set, the RichWPSProvider is able to 
                perform an wps:execute()-Request and to obtain the resulting data.
            </p>
            <p><b>DeployRequestDTO</b>
                Object that can be used to perform an wpst:deploy()-Request.
            </p>
